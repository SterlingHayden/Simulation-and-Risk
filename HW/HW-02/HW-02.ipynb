    "### Year 0 Expenses\n",
    "- **Seismic and Lease Costs**: These depend on the number of wells. Leased acres per well follow a normal distribution (mean = 600, SD = 50), with a price of $960 per acre. Seismic sections per well also follow a normal distribution (mean = 3, SD = 0.35), costing $43,000 per section.\n",
    "- **Completion Costs**: If the well is not dry, preparation for oil production incurs a normally distributed cost (mean = $390,000, SD = $50,000).\n",
    "- **Professional Overhead**: Project team salary and benefits per well follow a triangular distribution (min = $172,000, most likely = $215,000, max = $279,500). These costs apply during Year 0 but cease if the well is dry.\n",

    "### Production Risk\n",
    "- **Initial Production**: The starting production rate in Year 1, following a Lognormal distribution (mean = 420 BOPD, SD = 120 BOPD), with an underlying Normal distribution (mean = 6, SD = 0.28).\n",
    "- **Decline Rate**: The annual percentage decrease in production, uniformly distributed between 15% and 32%, remaining constant for each well's lifespan.\n",
    "- A correlation coefficient of 0.64 is imposed between initial production & decline rate in the simulation.\n",

    "### Revenue Risk\n",
    "- **Net Revenue Interest**: The company retains a portion of revenue after royalties, modeled as a Normal distribution (mean 75%, SD 2%) per well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operating Expenses\n",
    "- **Operating Costs**: Expenses for manpower and hardware are modeled as a Normal distribution with a mean of $2.25 per barrel (SD $0.30). Costs are the same for all wells in a given year but vary annually.\n",
    "- **Severance Taxes**: A fixed 4.6% tax on revenue, applied after the NRI.\n",
